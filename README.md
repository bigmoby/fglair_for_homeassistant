## Installation

### Manual

1. Create this directory path `custom_components/fglair_heatpump_controller/` if it does not already exist.

2. Download the all `custom_components/fglair_heatpump_controller/` files from the repo and place it in the directory mentioned in previous step.

### HACS

1. Add this repository to HACS:

```
https://github.com/bigmoby/fglair_for_homeassistant
```

2. Search for the `FGLair integration for homeassistant` integration and choose install.

3. Reboot Home Assistant.

### Usage:

In Home Assistant->Settings->Device & services->Integration menu add the new integration FGLair and configure it.

Please, use your FGLair app username/password and region your FGLair account is registered (choose one of `region`: `eu`, `cn` or `us`). For `tokenpath` field you could leave the default value `token.txt`. You could set a proper `temperature_offset`, default will be `2`.

Attention: please, remove from `configuration.yaml` any previous FGLair installation setup.

Note for A/C units with horizontal swing support, the horizontal swing and position can be changed but only the vertical position will be shown due to limitations with Home Assistant's climate entity.

## Known issues and missing features:

- [x] Logging needs to be implemented
- [x] The “powerful” functionality is implemented via the preset selections in the UI
- [ ] There are some other functionalities in the A/C which currently is not implemented.
- [ ] Possibility to add external temperature sensor
